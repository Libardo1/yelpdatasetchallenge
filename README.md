Yelp Dataset Challenge
====================

Trevor Martin and Ryo Kita's entry into the 2014 Yelp Dataset Challenge (http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge). 

This repository's code is divided into two sections: 

Folder Name  | Language | Number of Files
------------- | ------------- | -------------
DataPreparation  | Python | 1
DataAnalysis  | R | 1

Note that the actual data must be downloaded from Yelp directly and then placed in the appropriate directories before these scripts can be run. 

The website created for this project can be found at: http://www.goodfoodbadservice.com. Website code available in the /web/ folder.
