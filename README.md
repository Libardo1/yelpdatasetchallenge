Yelp Dataset Challenge
====================

Trevor Martin and Ryo Kita's entry into the 2014 Yelp Dataset Challenge (http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge). 

This repository's code is divided into two sections: 

Folder Name  | Language | Number of Files
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Data Preparation  | Python | x
Data Analysis  | R | x

Note that the actual data must be downloaded from Yelp directly and then placed in the appropriate directories before these scripts can be run.
