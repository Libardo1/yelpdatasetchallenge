Yelp Dataset Challenge
====================

Trevor Martin and Ryo Kita's entry into the 2014 Yelp Dataset Challenge (http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge). 

Code is divided into two sections: 

Data Preparation (Python)
Data Analsis (R)

Note that the actual data must be downloaded from Yelp directly.
