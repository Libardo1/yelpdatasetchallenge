	<div id="intro_header">Would you go to a GFBS?</div>
	<div id="intro_text">We have all been to a GFBS restaurant: Good Food, Bad Service. &nbsp; A restaurant serving dishes from <span style = "color: green">food heaven</span>, but also staffed with <span style= "color: red">incompetent, inattentive servers</span>.<br><br>
	GFBSs are everywhere. &nbsp; Some people want a little love during their dining experience and probably avoid these restaurants. &nbsp; But other people, often while exalting themselves as a "foodie", flock to the GFBS like pigeons picking at croissants on the street.  &nbsp; Whatever your preference, you probably want to know which restaurants are GFBSs.<br><br>
	<span style="font-weight: 600"><em>So can we figure out if a restaurant is a GFBS?</em></span><br><br>
	Yelp - as handy as it is - only has one metric for rating a restaurant. &nbsp; The rating of 1 to 5 stars reflects both the quality of the service AND the food. &nbsp; So if a restaurant has a rating of 1 star - we <em>can't tell</em> whether the low score reflects appalling service <em> or</em> disgusting food.<br><br>
	But we weren't disheartened by this. &nbsp; Yelp reviewers couple their star rating with a description of their experience. &nbsp; Using the text data combined with the rating - we have found a way to find these GFBSs. &nbsp; So for you foodies out there - don't be fooled by the 3 star rating - the food at these restaurants may in fact be delicious!</div>
